My Online Store
Date: 2025-05-19

This is a simple React app for an online store, created as part of my learning journey with the help of AI assistance (ChatGPT). This project helps me practice React, JavaScript, and working with modern web development tools.

How to run
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/izuhp/my-online-store.git

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

What Iâ€™m learning
React basics: components, JSX, state, and props

Using Node and npm for package management

Git version control and GitHub for collaboration and backup
